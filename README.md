- Features: +, -, *, /, **optional exponentiation**
- Cybersecurity twist: Validate user input to avoid crashes (e.g., handle dividing by zero, invalid characters)

Step 1: Plan


Decide what the calculator will do


What inputs does it need?


What operations should it handle?


How will you show the result?




Write this out in plain words first.

Step 2: Input


Think about how Python asks for input.


How will you store the numbers for calculation?


What data type will they be?



Step 3: Choose Operation


How will the user tell the program which operation to perform?


How will Python decide what to do with that input?



Step 4: Conditional Logic


Map each operation to the correct action.


What Python structure allows you to choose between options?



Step 5: Display Result


Once the calculation is done, how will the program show it?



Step 6: Make it Robust


What happens if the user types letters instead of numbers?


What happens if they try to divide by zero?



Step 7: Looping


How will you let the user do multiple calculations without restarting the program?


What kind of loop would work best?



Stretch Ideas


Add exponentiation or modulo operations


Keep a log of all calculations


Add a way to exit gracefully



💡 The key here is to think in steps and write it yourself. No copy-pasting, no AI, just you, Python, and your brain.
